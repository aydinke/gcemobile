Configuration assumptions:
- setup your EDRT2 with "Sorties Virtuelles"
- VO1 = Heating, VO2 = Hot water, VO3 = VMC
- all timing assumes use of "Sc√©narios" configuration in the EDRT2
- the IP address / port / apikey is configured using the web interface of this web app
- these details are stored using the "localstorage" method, so not kept on any remote server
- localstorage lost if cache cleared
- note security concern, the EDRT2 only has an http interface, not https
